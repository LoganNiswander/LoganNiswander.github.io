            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I'm Logan, a senior studying computer science at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan. 
                I am passionate about technology and the positive change it can bring to the world. 
                While not occupied with class work, I enjoy learning about software engineering, cloud technologies and human-centered design. 
                I also enjoy working on my own personal projects involving these technolgies. I am currently looking for exciting fulltime
                opportunities and will be graduating in April of 2022.

            <h2>My Experience</h2>
            <p>
              While a student at the University of Michigan I have gained experience with software development and technology. 
              Through my previous computer science courses, I have worked with various programming languages and programming 
              fundamentals, such as data structures and algorithms, data analytics, and machine learning. I have also worked with Linux, 
              Visual Studio, HTML/CSS, and source control such as GitHub. In the summer of 2021 I interned for Amazon Web Services as 
              a Software Development Engineering intern and built a scabale cloud service from the ground up. As an intern for AWS I gained
              experience designing and devloping my own service with the goal of increasing effeciency and accessibility for the customers
              of my team. Outside of class I enjoy serving as the documentation lead for the Google Developer Student Club. In this role I get
              to work on technical documentation for the Developer Student Club and also run communication netowrks for the club.
              All of these experiences have shaped and reinforced my current career interests in software engineering.
